FIRST TEST PROJECT

A simple jquery plugin: number spinner. 
Currently this plugin adds two buttons to a text input. With these buttons any number can be in- or decreased.
This plugin doesn's feature any css, but that's basically the point.

TODO:
add cursor and scroll mouse support
add html and css demo files
add support for buttons before the input, currently the buttons are added after the input.
